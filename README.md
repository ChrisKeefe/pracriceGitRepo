## Alternative projects to support
When you're ready to contribute to a _slightly_ more real project, consider one of the following:

- [GetGitPresentation](https://github.com/chriskeefe/getgitpresentation): LaTeX - You saw our terrible introduction to Git. Help make it better. :)
- [249 Code Formatting Profiles](https://github.com/acmatnau/Leverington): XML, etc - Dr. Leverington has strict code style standards. If your IDE or editor has the ability to import/export formatting profiles, configure one that works and share with your fellow students. 
- [Jiggety](https://github.com/ChrisKeefe/jiggety/blob/master/README.md): BASH - @ChrisKeefe's linuxmint configuration scripts - if you're a Mint user and want to improve the fresh-install experience, this could be a reasonable place to start. 
- [Open Hacktoberfest Issues](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen&s=updated&type=Issues): Any language, any skill level. Go find your happy place!
